# Wordle Android App

Welcome to the Wordle Android App! This open-source project brings the popular word-guessing game "Wordle" to your Android device, providing enjoyable gameplay.

## Introduction

Wordle is a simple yet addictive game where players attempt to guess a hidden five-letter word. With each guess, the game provides feedback on the accuracy of the guessed word, helping players deduce the correct word through a process of elimination.

## Rules of the Game

The rules of Wordle are straightforward:

1. The game randomly selects a five-letter word from a predefined list of words.
2. Players make guesses by entering five-letter words.
3. After each guess, the game provides feedback in the form of colored dots:
   - A green dot indicates that a letter in the guessed word is both correct and in the correct position.
   - A orange dot indicates that a letter in the guessed word is correct but in the wrong position.
   - A gray dot indicates that a letter in the guessed word is incorrect.
4. Players continue making guesses until they correctly guess the hidden word or run out of attempts.
